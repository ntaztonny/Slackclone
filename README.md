# About the app:

The application is a clone for spotify's messaging functionality. You can find the deployed app on: https://slackclone-e4844.web.app/

# Functionality

The application is a chatting app where:
=> You can add chatting rooms (channels).
=> In any selected channel, you can chat flowlessly. Just select the channel you have created or a channel already present and send a message.

# Development

=> The application is developed with React JS, using a redux context API to manage the state of events and user's information including picture , names etc.
=> Firebase (firebase-react-hooks) is used to manage authetication i.e sign-in and sign-out: I chose the google authetication but any other means like email, apple and other authetication can be used.
=> In addition, styled components were used for styling the UI. Material-UI was also used to add avators and also for the icons.
