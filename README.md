# Development

=> The application is developed with React JS, using a redux context API to manage the state of events and user's information including picture , names etc.<br />
=> Firebase (firebase-react-hooks) is used to manage authetication i.e sign-in and sign-out: I chose the google authetication but any other means like email, apple and other authetication can be used.<br />
